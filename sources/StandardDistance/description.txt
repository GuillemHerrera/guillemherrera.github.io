    Standard Distance Analysis
</h1>
<p>
Standard Distance measures the degree to which features are concentrated or dispersed around the features. Bigger circles shows disgregated population in a counties against smaller circels (with smaller Standard Distance values).

Also we can observe tematic visualitzation off population. Barcelona's areas have the biggest population value, with smaller Standard distance values (high density)
